1.Run train_frcnn.py -o simple -p annotate.txt to run the RCNN training.[YOu can directly download the weights from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v5oFrSnrLyr4-DgS1D6rCA20z30O0GSX/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uR7B4DXbOBur1uBPPGGrTWk4Q8Yz5vrF/view?usp=sharing ] model_frcnn.hdf5 is the worse one. model_frcnn_2.hdf5 is the better one.
And put them in current dir.

2.And run RCNN_Test.ipynb to detect ears. Run resize.py to resize the detected images.
[You only have download the results(resized_cropped_detection and resized_detection_2) from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YwM0I2ulZUcrwt95GTf_nW9qIrH9PklR?usp=sharing] and put them in '../resized_cropped_detection' and '../resized_detection_2'
resized_cropped_detection is results generated by worse model. resized_detection_2 is the better one.

3.To run the verification model, run Test_Direct.ipynb to test the acc. models can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T95SDn-Ltl4GqWAUHLj1bdvnDeJ41dPq?usp=sharing

Direct_Train.ipynb is the training part of the simple model.
Triplet_Training.ipynb is the training part of the Triplet Loss.
Mixed_Df.csv is the training set of Triplet Loss

easy_more.csv,easy_more2.csv are training sets of the whole model.
Feature_and_cls.csv is used to generate pair training sets for the whole model.
RCNN_Annotation.ipynb is to genetate annotate.txt
